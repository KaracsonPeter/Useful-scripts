# Useful-scripts
This is a repo to store &amp; share my tiny scripts that made my life easier a lot.  
Unfortunately, there are meny hardcoded things in this, because it was easier and faster for me than creating nice GUIs for them.  
To use this repo, you must know some basics of python programming.  
(What's a venv, how to create one, what's a variable.)


## What it contains:
 - Helpers to organize your family pictures in `organise_images`
